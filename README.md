I’m interested in learning all about web development, software development, and everything about the technical world! I’m currently learning about object-oriented programming in Java and EclipseIDE. I have learned Python in my first year of coding, and have touched on some HTML thanks to my years editing on Wikipedia.

You can reach out to me through email (bregiang@gmail.com)! I check it regularly. 

Skills: Python / Java / EclipseIDE / HTML
